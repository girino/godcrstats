Stats API and page for deCRED writen in golang

This is an atempt at replacing dcr-netstats, but writen entirely in golang.

For now, it just proveides profitability data through the API at
http://localhost:8080/ap1/v1/profitability

The idea is to provide all data  through an json REST api, and eventually,
an web page that consumes the servides as index.
